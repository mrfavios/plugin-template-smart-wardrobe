# Smart Wardrobe Plugin Template

This repository provides a template for creating plugins for the Smart Wardrobe application. There are two examples provided to demonstrate how to create plugins.

## Installation

To install a plugin, place the plugin's Python file and folder with the plugin's name into the `plugins` directory of the Smart Wardrobe application. The Python file should have the same name as the class it defines.

### Files
